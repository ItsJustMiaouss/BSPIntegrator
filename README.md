> There's a new tool called [AutoBSPpackingTool](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/AutoBSPpackingTool) (GitHub: [drinklc/AutoBSPpackingTool](https://github.com/drinklc/AutoBSPpackingTool)) which is new and very powerful to detect game content of ``garrysmod/cfg/mount.cfg`` and your ``.vmf``, then embed automatically content to your ``.bsp``.

## BSPIntegrator

This is a tool I used for [gm_ijm_boreas](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2903049970), to embed files into the compiled [BSP file](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSP).
