## BSPIntegrator

This is a tool I used for [gm_ijm_boreas](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2903049970), to embed files into the compiled [BSP File](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSP) file.

> Moltard/BspZipGUI (https://github.com/Moltard/BspZipGUI) is a similar project I recently found that seems more suitable for most projects. Consider using this tool if you're not compiling a specific map.
